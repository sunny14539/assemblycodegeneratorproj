# Assembly Code Generator Project
This project is an assembly code generator for the made up language RAT18S.  
To compile the program, type into the terminal  
`g++ -std=c++17 AssemblyCodeGen.cpp -o AssemblyCodeGen`  
and type to run the program  
`./AssemblyCodeGen`  
This program will generate the symbol table and the assembly instruction based on the content provided in `output.txt`.
